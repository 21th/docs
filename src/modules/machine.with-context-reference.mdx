# machine.withContext

Or for existing machines, `machine.withContext(...)` should be used:

```js
const counterMachine = createMachine({
  /* ... */
});

// retrieved dynamically
const someContext = { count: 42, time: Date.now() };

const dynamicCounterMachine =
  counterMachine.withContext(someContext);
```

The initial context of a machine can be retrieved from its initial state:

```js
dynamicCounterMachine.initialState.context;
// => { count: 42, time: 1543687816981 }
```

This is preferred to accessing `machine.context` directly, since the initial state is computed with initial `assign(...)` actions and transient transitions, if any.
