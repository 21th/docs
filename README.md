# Welcome to the Stately docs for Stately Studio and XState

Our docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

We welcome any contributions to the documentation and code base.

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Local development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Note on the index page

Currently we serve the root from a static `index.html` file under `static`.
This does not work when running `yarn start`, but it does work after a build when you run `yarn serve`.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

## Deployment

The docs are built and deployed when merged into `main`.
