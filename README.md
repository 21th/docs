# Welcome to the Stately docs for Stately Studio and XState

Our docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Installation

1.
```
$ yarn
```

### Local development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

### Deployment

The docs are built and deployed when merged into `main`.
