Callback services are one way to start invoking long-lived services and are useful for simple to intermediate cases. But sometimes, you’ll want to use all the power of a statechart.

*Machine services* are valuable for such use cases. You can pass a machine directly to the `invoke` `src` property to invoke the machine in that state.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const childMachine = createMachine({
  /* ... */
});

const parentMachine = createMachine({
  invoke: {
    src: childMachine,
  },
});
```

Just like with callback services, the child machine is stopped if the state where it’s invoked is exited.

Machine services enable you to create machines that can act as reusable modules across your application.
