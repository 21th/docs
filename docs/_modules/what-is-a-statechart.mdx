Statecharts are a visual language used to describe the states in a process.

You may have used similar diagrams in the past to design user flows, plan databases or map app architecture. Statecharts are another way of using boxes and arrows to represent flows, but with XState, these flows are also executable code you can use to control the logic in your applications.

[Install XState](/getting-started/installation) and create a statechart by importing `createMachine` from `xstate`.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  // statechart config goes here
});
```
