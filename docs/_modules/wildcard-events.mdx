A transition specified with a wildcard `*` is activated by any event not already handled by the current state.

The following example shows a few different cases of when the wildcard `*` is activated or not.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "inactive",
  on: {
    "*": {
      actions: "logEventToConsole",
    },
    FOCUS: {
      actions: "onFocus",
    },
  },
  states: {
    inactive: {
      on: {
        HOVER: {
          actions: "onHover",
        },
      },
    },
    active: {},
  },
});
```

- If the `HOVER` event is received in the `inactive` state, it’ll trigger the `onHover` action. The wildcard won’t be called.
- If the `HOVER` event is received in the `active` state, it’ll be caught by the wildcard above it and will `logEventToConsole`.
- If the `FOCUS` event is received in any state, it’ll trigger the `onFocus` action, not the wildcard.

Wildcard events are great for logging untracked events or reducing code duplication.
