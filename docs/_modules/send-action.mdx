XStateâ€™s built-in `send` action is useful for when statecharts need to send events back to themselves.

When the send action is executed, it sends an event back to the machine _as if it were from an external source_.

This pattern can help compose different flows together. In the example below, the user can either press the `copy` button or press `ctrl + c` to fire a `COPY` event to the machine. Using the `send` action to fire the same event from both actions reduces duplication.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, send } from "xstate";

const keyboardShortcutMachine = createMachine({
  on: {
    PRESS_COPY_BUTTON: {
      actions: send({ type: "COPY" }),
    },
    PRESS_CTRL_C: {
      actions: send({ type: "COPY" }),
    },
    COPY: {
      actions: "copyToClipboard",
    },
  },
});
```

You can also dynamically specify the event to send by passing a function to `send`:

```ts twoslash
import { send } from "xstate";
// ---cut---
send((context, event) => {
  return {
    type: "SOME_EVENT",
  };
});
```
