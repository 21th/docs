You can add descriptions to transitions to illustrate what they do. 

This text is used by the [visualizer](/tools/visualizer) and the [visual editor](/tools/visual-editor) to make the diagrams more descriptive.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  on: {
    SAY_HELLO: {
      actions: "sayHello",
      description: "Runs the sayHello action",
    },
  },
});
```
