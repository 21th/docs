You can use XState with React to:

- Coordinate local state
- Manage global state performantly
- Consume data from other hooks

We provide the official `@xstate/react` package to help you manage the integration. The package provides several hooks and helpers to get you started.

### Installation

Install the `@xstate/react` package [using npm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#adding_powerups):

```bash
npm install xstate @xstate/react
```
