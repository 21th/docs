When running a machine, you can check `state.done` to find out if an actor has reached its final state.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, interpret } from "xstate";

const answeringMachine = createMachine({
  initial: "unanswered",
  states: {
    unanswered: {
      on: {
        ANSWER: { target: "answered" },
      },
    },
    answered: {
      type: "final",
    },
  },
});

const actor = interpret(answeringMachine).start();

actor.send({
  type: "ANSWER",
});

actor.state.done; // true
```
