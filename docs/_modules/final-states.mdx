Most processes with states will have a _final state_, the last state when the process is finished. The final state is represented by a double border on the stateâ€™s rounded rectangle box.

In the dog walking statechart, the final state would be **walk complete**.

To indicate that a state node is final, set its `type` property to `final`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "waiting",
  states: {
    waiting: {
      after: {
        4000: "stopped",
      },
    },
    stopped: {
      type: "final",
    },
  },
});
```

The machine above will wait for 4 seconds and then stop.

When a machine reaches its final state, several things happen:

- The machine stops being able to receive events
- Any running timers/services inside the machine are canceled and cleaned up

Final states give you the option for an idiomatic way of cleaning up your machine.
