Use the `.target` syntax to transition to a child state from a parent state.

The following machine uses the `.target` syntax for `.hovered`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "inactive",
  on: {
    HOVER: ".hovered",
  },
  states: {
    inactive: {},
    hovered: {},
    visited: {},
  },
});
```

Whichever state the machine is in, whenever it receives a `HOVER` event, itâ€™ll transition to the `hovered` state.
