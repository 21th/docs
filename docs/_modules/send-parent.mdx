Child machines can communicate to the parent that invoked them via the `sendParent` action.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, sendParent } from "xstate";

const childMachine = createMachine({
  after: {
    3000: {
      actions: sendParent({
        type: "TIMER_DONE",
      }),
    },
  },
});

const parentMachine = createMachine({
  initial: "waiting",
  states: {
    waiting: {
      on: {
        TIMER_DONE: {
          target: "complete",
        },
      },
      invoke: {
        src: childMachine,
      },
    },
    complete: {
      type: "final",
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, the `parentMachine` invokes the `childMachine` in the `waiting` state. Three seconds after being started, the `childMachine` sends the `TIMER_DONE` event to its parent. The `TIMER_DONE` transition in the `parentMachine` puts the machine into the `complete` state.

### Only use sendParent on child machines

If the child machine doesnâ€™t have a parent, for instance, if the machine is run with `interpret`, then `sendParent` will throw an error.
