You can use actions and guards together to run actions conditionally on transitions.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const atmMachine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      balance: 20,
    },
    initial: "showingBalance",
    states: {
      showingBalance: {
        on: {
          WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS: {
            cond: "hasAtLeastTenDollars",
            actions: "logTenDollarsComing",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    guards: {
      hasAtLeastTenDollars: (context) => {
        return context.balance >= 10;
      },
    },
    actions: {
      logTenDollarsComing: () => {
        console.log(`Here's your ten dollars!`);
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, when the user withdraws ten dollars via `WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS`, we check first if the balance in `context` has at least 10 dollars.

We can add an else condition to `WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS` too:

```ts twoslash {11-19}
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

// ---cut---

const atmMachine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      balance: 20,
    },
    initial: "showingBalance",
    states: {
      showingBalance: {
        on: {
          WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS: [
            {
              cond: "hasAtLeastTenDollars",
              actions: "logTenDollarsComing",
            },
            {
              actions: "sayThereIsNotEnoughInTheAccount",
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    guards: {
      hasAtLeastTenDollars: (context) => {
        return context.balance >= 10;
      },
    },
    actions: {
      logTenDollarsComing: () => {
        console.log(`Here's your ten dollars!`);
      },
      sayThereIsNotEnoughInTheAccount: () => {
        console.log("Not enough in the account!");
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, if we have at least ten dollars in the account, we’ll log that the dollars are coming. Else, we’ll log that there’s not enough in the account.

Remember, **the cond always runs _before_ the action**. XState first checks if it should run the action by running the `cond`, and only then runs the action.

Sometimes you’ll want to run actions on every branch of a transition. Read our tip for that use case below.
