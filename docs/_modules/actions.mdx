## Side effects

You may have come across a type of function called a _[pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)_. A function is ‘pure’ if it takes in an input, returns a predictable output, and does _nothing else_. Pure functions do not involve:

- Waiting a set amount of time
- Making an API call to an external service
- Logging things to the console

We can think of the processes above as [side effects](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>) of our program running. The name gives them a negative medical connotation, but they’re incredibly important. Processes that don’t have side effects don’t talk to anything external, don’t worry about time, and don’t react to unexpected errors.

Statecharts give you a great deal of control over running side effects in your app. The first method is through actions.

## Actions

Actions are side effects which are:

- **Fire-and-forget**: Actions don’t talk back to the statechart.
- **Unlikely to fail**. Actions are unlikely to impact the system if they fail.
- Usually **synchronous**. For example, you don’t `await` actions.

Some examples of actions are:

- Logging something to the console
- Assigning a value to a variable
- Changing the attribute of a DOM node

You can fire an action upon entering or exiting a state by using the `entry` and `exit` attributes on that state.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: 'visiting',
    states: {
      visiting: {
        entry: 'sayHello',
        exit: 'sayGoodbye',
        on: {
          LEAVE: 'notVisiting',
        },
      },
      notVisiting: {},
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      sayHello: () => {
        console.log('Hello');
      },
      sayGoodbye: () => {
        console.log('Goodbye');
      },
    },
  }
);
```

You can also fire an action on a transition:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: 'toggledOn',
    states: {
      toggledOn: {
        on: {
          TOGGLE: {
            target: 'toggledOff',
            actions: 'sayToggled',
          },
        },
      },
      toggledOff: {
        on: {
          TOGGLE: {
            target: 'toggledOn',
            actions: 'sayToggled',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      sayToggled: () => {
        console.log('Toggled!');
      },
    },
  }
);
```

Anywhere you can use an action, you can also declare it as an array to express multiple actions.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    entry: ['youSayGoodbye', 'iSayHello'],
  },
  {
    actions: {
      iSayHello: () => {
        console.log('Me: Hello');
      },
      youSayGoodbye: () => {
        console.log('You: Goodbye');
      },
    },
  }
);
```

In the example above, `Me: Hello` will be logged to the console, followed by `You: Goodbye`.
