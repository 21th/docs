If you want _all_ events sent to the parent to be forwarded to the child, you can specify `autoForward: true` on an `invoke`.

In the example below, _any_ event the machine receives will be sent on to the `eventHandler`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    invoke: {
      src: "eventHandler",
      autoForward: true,
    },
  },
  {
    services: {
      eventHandler: () => (sendBack, onReceive) => {
        onReceive((event) => {
          // Handle the forwarded event here
        });
      },
    },
  },
);
```
