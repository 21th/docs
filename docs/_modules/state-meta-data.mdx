You can attach arbitrary data to any state by specifying it as `meta` on the state node:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, interpret } from "xstate";

const fetchMachine = createMachine({
  initial: "pending",
  states: {
    pending: {
      on: {
        UNKNOWN_ERROR: "errored",
      },
      after: {
        5000: "timedOut",
      },
    },
    errored: {
      meta: {
        error: "An unknown error occurred",
      },
    },
    timedOut: {
      meta: {
        error: "Timeout error!",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can store anything in the `meta` attribute; XState doesnâ€™t monitor it or do anything with its contents.

The current state of the machine collects the `meta` data of all of the state nodes, represented by the state value, and places them on an object where:

- The keys are the state node IDs
- The values are the state node `meta` values

For instance, if the machine above is in the `timedOut` state, the `meta` will be an object with the following shape:

```js
{
  timedOut: {
    alert: 'Timeout error!'
  },
}
```
