You’ll often want to use the parent machine to “forward” events to the child machine. To handle this, XState provides a built-in `forwardTo` action:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, forwardTo } from "xstate";

const alertMachine = createMachine(
  {
    on: {
      ALERT: {
        actions: "soundTheAlarm",
      },
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      soundTheAlarm: () => {
        alert("Oh no!");
      },
    },
  },
);

const parentMachine = createMachine({
  id: "parent",
  invoke: {
    id: "alerter",
    src: alertMachine,
  },
  on: {
    ALERT: { actions: forwardTo("alerter") },
  },
});
```
