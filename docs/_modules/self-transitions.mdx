A self-transition is when an event happens, but the transition returns to the same state. The transition arrow exits and re-enters the same state.

A helpful way to describe a self-transition is “doing something, not going somewhere” in the process.

In a **dog begging** process, there would be a **begging** state with a **gets treat** event. And for the dogs who love their food, no matter how many times you go through the **gets treat** event, the dog returns to its **begging** state.

Self-transitions are helpful when you want to fire an action, but not leave your current state. You can use an action on the transition to fire it whenever that event is received.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

createMachine(
  {
    initial: 'begging',
    states: {
      begging: {
        on: {
          'gets treat': {
            actions: 'makeHappySnufflingSound',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {
      makeHappySnufflingSound: () => {
        console.log('Snuffle snuffle snuffle');
      },
    },
  }
);
```
