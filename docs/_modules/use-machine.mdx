The simplest way to get started with interpreting actors in React is `useMachine`. `useMachine` is a [React hook](https://reactjs.org/hooks) that interprets the given `machine` and starts an actor that runs for the lifetime of the component.

```tsx twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

const machine = createMachine({});

const Component = () => {
  const [
    // The current state of the actor
    state,
    // A function to send the machine events
    send,
    // The running actor - used for passing to `useActor`
    actor,
  ] = useMachine(machine);

  return null;
};
```

You can also pass machine options to the second argument of `useMachine`. These options will be kept up to date when the component re-renders, which means they can safely access variables inside the componentâ€™s scope:

```tsx twoslash
const useLoggedInUserId = (): string => "123";
// ---cut---

import { createMachine } from "xstate";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

const machine = createMachine({
  entry: "consoleLogUserId",
});

const Component = () => {
  const id = useLoggedInUserId();

  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine, {
    actions: {
      consoleLogUserId: () => {
        console.log(id);
      },
    },
  });

  return null;
};
```
