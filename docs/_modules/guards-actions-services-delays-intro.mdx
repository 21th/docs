There are four types of options you can pass to your statechart.

### Guards

Guards allow you to check something before you proceed, enabling you to implement if/else logic in XState. 

Below is an example of a guard:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

let iAmHappyAndIKnowIt = true;

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: "notClappingHands",
    states: {
      notClappingHands: {
        on: {
          HEAR_MUSIC: {
            /**
             * Name the guard…
             */
            cond: "ifYoureHappyAndYouKnowIt",
            target: "clappingHands",
          },
        },
      },
      clappingHands: {},
    },
  },
  {
    guards: {
      /**
       * …then implement the guard.
       */
      ifYoureHappyAndYouKnowIt: () => {
        return iAmHappyAndIKnowIt;
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, the guard is activated when the machine is in the `notClappingHands` state and reaches the `HEAR_MUSIC` event. If the `ifYoureHappyAndYouKnowIt` guard is true, the machine will go to the `clappingHands` state.

### Actions

Actions allow you to perform simple actions, such as assigning to a variable or calling synchronous actions:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    entry: ["sayHello"],
  },
  {
    actions: {
      sayHello: () => {
        console.log("Hello!");
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, `sayHello` will be called when the machine is started.

### Services

Services are used for running long-running processes in XState. Some typical processes might be:

- Subscribing to a websocket/DOM listener for updates
- Waiting for a promise to resolve
- Uploading a file

We’ll revisit services in more depth later. [Take a fast track to learn more about services](/path-to/services).

### Delays

Delays are used in XState to represent timers and intervals. We’ll revisit delays in more depth later. [Take a fast track to learn more about delays](/path-to/dynamic-after).
