In TypeScript, you can strongly type your events by passing a _[union type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types)_ of all the events to the `schema` property.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  schema: {
    events: {} as
      | { type: "LOG_OUT" }
      | { type: "LOG_IN"; value: string }
      | { type: "COUNTDOWN"; value: number },
  },
});
```

Wherever you send an event to a machine, or access the event inside the machine, the event will be strongly typed.
