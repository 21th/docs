Invoked callbacks can listen to events from the parent. To manage this, they receive an `onReceive` argument.

In the example below, the parent machine sends the child `ponger` service a `PING` event. The child service can listen for that event using `onReceive(listener)` and send a `PONG` event back to the parent in response.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, send } from "xstate";

const pingPongMachine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: "active",
    states: {
      active: {
        invoke: {
          id: "ponger",
          src: "pongService",
        },
        entry: send({ type: "PING" }, { to: "ponger" }),
        on: {
          PONG: { target: "done" },
        },
      },
      done: {},
    },
  },
  {
    services: {
      pongService: () => (sendBack, onReceive) => {
        // Whenever parent sends 'PING',
        // send parent 'PONG' event
        onReceive((e) => {
          if (e.type === "PING") {
            sendBack("PONG");
          }
        });
      },
    },
  },
);
```
