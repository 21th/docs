If you want to transition to _any_ state:

1. Give the state node an `id`, for example, `myState`
2. Target the state node with a `#` prefix: `#myState`

The approach above works for transitioning to any state node from any state node, so it’s a useful trick if you can’t target a state with the `.a` or `a.b` syntaxes.

The example below shows the `paused` state with an `id` of `playerPaused` and that `id` targeted using `#playerPaused`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const musicMachine = createMachine({
  initial: "playing",
  states: {
    playing: {
      initial: "playingTrackOne",
      states: {
        playingTrackOne: {
          on: {
            PAUSE: {
              target: "#playerPaused",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    paused: {
      id: "playerPaused",
    },
  },
});
```

You can also give the root of your machine an `id` and combine the use of the root machine’s `id` with the `a.b` syntax.

The example below shows the machine’s root with an `id` of `player` and the `paused` state targeted using `#player.paused`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const musicMachine = createMachine({
  id: "player",
  initial: "playing",
  states: {
    playing: {
      initial: "playingTrackOne",
      states: {
        playingTrackOne: {
          on: {
            PAUSE: {
              target: "#player.paused",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    paused: {},
  },
});
```

Combining a machine’s root `id` with the use of the `a.b` syntax can help you reduce the number of state `id`s required.
