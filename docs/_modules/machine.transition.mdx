You can use `machine.transition` to run your machine as a pure function without executing any of its actions. `machine.transition` is a pure function that takes two arguments:

- `state`, the `State` to transition from
- `event`, the event that causes the transition

`machine.transition` returns a new `State` resulting from taking all the transitions enabled by the current state and event.

```js
const machine = createMachine({
  /* ... */
});

const initialState = machine.initialState;

// determine next state based on current state and event
const yellowState = machine.transition(initialState, {
  type: "TIMER",
});

console.log(yellowState.value);
// => 'yellow'
```
