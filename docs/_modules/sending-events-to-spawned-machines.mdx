Events can be sent to spawned actors by passing a function to `send` or `forwardTo`:

```ts
send(
  { type: "INC" },
  { to: (context) => context.counterRef },
);

forwardTo({ to: (context) => context.counterRef });
```

{/* TODO - are there any other API's which need to be mentioned here? */}

You can also forward _all_ events to the child by passing `autoForward` as an option to `spawn`:

```ts twoslash
import { spawn, createMachine, assign } from "xstate";

const childMachine = createMachine({});

// ---cut---
const machine = createMachine({
  entry: assign((context) => ({
    counterRef: spawn(childMachine, {
      autoForward: true,
    }),
  })),
});
```

Passing `autoForward` will ensure that every event sent to the `machine` also gets forwarded to `childMachine`.
