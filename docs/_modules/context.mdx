{/* TODO: Rewrite with focus on context as a data store vs finite/infinite states */}

Statecharts represent their finite state using `states` but can also handle states which are _not_ finite. These states might be:

- Counters, which can be incremented as many times as required.
- Text inputs, where the user might enter any value.

This “infinite” state can be stored in a statechart’s **context**, a data store that can be updated only by the statechart itself.

You can pass a machine its context using the `context` property:

```ts twoslash {2-4}
import { createMachine } from "xstate";
// ---cut---
const machine = createMachine({
  context: {
    count: 0,
  },
});
```
