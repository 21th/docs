Sometimes youâ€™ll need a transition to target multiple parts of a parallel state simultaneously. This is useful when you want to affect different parts of a simultaneous process at the same time.

Multiple targets are specified as an array in `target: [...]`.

```ts twoslash {24-26}
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const settingsMachine = createMachine({
  type: "parallel",
  states: {
    mode: {
      initial: "active",
      states: {
        inactive: {},
        pending: {},
        active: {},
      },
    },
    status: {
      initial: "enabled",
      states: {
        disabled: {},
        enabled: {},
      },
    },
  },
  on: {
    // Multiple targets
    DEACTIVATE: {
      target: [".mode.inactive", ".status.disabled"],
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, the `DEACTIVATE` event simultaneously causes _two_ changes, disabling the `status` and turning the `mode` to `inactive`.
