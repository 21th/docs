Transition directly into a nodeâ€™s children using the `a.b` syntax.

The following machine uses the `a.b` syntax for `.hovered`:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "inactive",
  states: {
    inactive: {
      on: {
        HOVER: "active.hovered",
      },
    },
    active: {
      initial: "focused",
      states: {
        focused: {},
        hovered: {},
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, the machine transitions directly to `active.hovered` when the `HOVER` event is received in state `inactive`.

The `initial` state of `focused` inside `active` is ignored.
