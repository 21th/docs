The `pure` action is useful when you need to run a dynamic number of actions depending on the current machineâ€™s state.

`pure` lets you pass a function to the machine, which calculates the type and number of actions to be executed.

In the example below, we check `context` to find which actions the machine should run.

{/* Remove noErrors when pure TS issue (https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3233) is fixed */}

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { actions, createMachine } from "xstate";

const { pure } = actions;

createMachine({
  context: {
    runBothActions: false,
  },
  entry: pure((context) => {
    if (context.runBothActions) {
      // You can return an array of actions
      return ["action1", "action2"];
    }
    // Or a single action
    return "action1";
  }),
});
```
