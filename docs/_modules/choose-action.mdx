The `choose()` built-in action is an alternative API for guarded actions. `choose` lets you pick which actions should be executed based on some conditions inside the action itself.

The `choose()` approach helps you be more flexible with where you run actions. For example, you can run actions inside an entry action:

```ts twoslash
import { actions, createMachine } from "xstate";

const logMachine = createMachine(
  {
    entry: actions.choose([
      {
        cond: "inBrowser",
        actions: "alertUser",
      },
      {
        actions: "logToUser",
      },
    ]),
  },
  {
    guards: {
      inBrowser: () => {
        return typeof window === "undefined";
      },
    },
    actions: {
      alertUser: () => {
        alert("Hello, browser!");
      },
      logToUser: () => {
        console.log("Hello, server!");
      },
    },
  },
);
```

Like all built-in actions, you must apply the result of `choose()` directly to an `actions` attribute. The following example will not work:

```ts twoslash
import { actions, createMachine } from "xstate";

// ---cut---
const logMachine = createMachine({
  entry: () => {
    // ðŸš« The following action just returns an object, 
    // it doesnâ€™t do anything
    actions.choose([
      {
        cond: "inBrowser",
        actions: "alertUser",
      },
      {
        actions: "logToUser",
      },
    ]);
  },
});
```
