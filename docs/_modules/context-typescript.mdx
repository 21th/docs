In TypeScript, you can strongly type your context by passing a type to the `schema` property, which means that wherever you access the context, whether inside actions or when running your machine, the context will be strongly typed.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const lightMachine = createMachine({
  schema: {
    context: {} as { value: number },
  },
});
```
