You can add descriptive text to states with the `description` attribute.

This text is used by the [visualizer](/tools/visualizer) and the [visual editor](/tools/visual-editor) to make the diagrams more descriptive.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "pending",
  description: `A machine that waits for something to happen, then completes`,
  states: {
    pending: {
      on: {
        FINISHED: "complete",
      },
      description: `Waiting...`,
    },
    complete: {
      description: `Done!`,
    },
  },
});
```
