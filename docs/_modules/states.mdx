The _states_ are represented by rounded rectangle boxes. When drawing a statechart for the process of a dog, two states would first come to mind:

{/* no alt because the image is already described in the surrounding text \ */}

![](/asleep-awake.svg)

A dog is always **asleep** or **awake**. The dog can’t be asleep and awake at the same time, and it’s impossible for the dog to be neither asleep nor awake. There are only these two states, a precisely limited, _finite_ number of states.

You can create these states in XState using the `states` property:

```ts twoslash {2-5}
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

// ---cut---
const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "asleep",
  states: {
    asleep: {},
    awake: {},
  },
});
```

Any process with states will also have an _initial state_, the default state in which the process exists until an event changes its state.
The initial state is represented by a filled circle with an arrow pointing from the circle to the initial state.

{/* no alt because the image is already described in the surrounding text \ */}

![](/initial-state.svg)

In a statechart describing the process of walking the dog, the initial state would be **waiting** to walk:

```ts twoslash {2}
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

// ---cut---
const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "waiting",
  states: {
    waiting: {},
  },
});
```
