title: Export as code
---

Exporting as code is useful if you want to use your machine with [XState](/xstate/intro) inside your codebase or if you want to duplicate your machine without using **Fork**.

You can export your machine as JSON, JavaScript, and TypeScript code using the code panel in the right tool menu. You can also export as code from the **Export machine** dialog using the export icon button in the editor’s top bar.

## Export code from the code panel

1. Open the **Code** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Use the JSON, JavaScript, or TypeScript buttons to display the code in your preferred format in the text area.
3. Use the **Copy** button to copy the code to your clipboard.
3. Paste into your code editor.

## Export code from the Export machine dialog

1. Use the export icon button in the editor’s top bar to open the **Export machine** dialog.
2. Use the JSON, JavaScript, or TypeScript button to copy the code in your preferred format to your clipboard.
