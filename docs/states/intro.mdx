Watch our [“What are states?” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6yhmSWUcc&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=2) (53s).

A state describes the machine’s status or mode, which could be as simple as *Paused* and *Playing*. A state machine can only be in one state at a time.

In the Stately Studio, the rounded rectangle boxes are states.

These states are “finite”; the machine can only move through the states you’ve pre-defined.

## How to create a state

1. Select your machine or an existing state.
2. Create a new state inside your machine or existing state:
    - Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state, or:
    - Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
    - Double-click inside your machine or an existing state.
