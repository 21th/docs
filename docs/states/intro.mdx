Watch our [“What are states?” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6yhmSWUcc&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=2) (53s).

A state describes the machine’s status or mode, which could be as simple as *Paused* and *Playing*. A state machine can only be in one state at a time.

[View this machine in the Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/registry/editor/e13bef2b-bb13-4465-96ac-0bc25340688e?machineId=741f69fd-7f01-4932-9407-6871e225bb6d).

In the Stately Studio, the rounded rectangle boxes are states. The **?** question mark icon in the machine above indicates an unreachable state. The state is unreachable because it isn’t connected to the [initial state](/states/initial-states/) by a [transition](/transitions-and-events/intro/).

:::

These states are “finite”; the machine can only move through the states you’ve pre-defined.

## How to create a state

1. Select your machine or an existing state.
2. Create a new state inside your machine or existing state:
    - Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state, or:
    - Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
    - Double-click inside your machine or an existing state.
