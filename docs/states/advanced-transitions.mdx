# Advanced transitions

Hierarchical states offer more opportunities for various types of transitions. You can transition from any state to any other state. XState has a few different syntaxes to help you out.

## Transitioning to a node’s own children

%{{ targeting-children }}

## Transitioning to another node’s children

%{{ targeting-children-of-siblings }}

## Transitioning to any node

%{{ transitioning-to-nodes-by-id }}
