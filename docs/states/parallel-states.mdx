A parallel state is a parent state separated into multiple regions of child states, where each region is active simultaneously.

A dashed line borders each region.

[TODO: Why you might use a parallel state with an example of parallel states.]

### How to make a state a parallel state

First, select the first state you want to set as a parallel state. Then…

#### Using the **quick actions** menu:

1. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **Parallel** from the **Type** options.

#### Using the **State details** panel:

1. Select the state you want to set as the final state.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose **Parallel** from the **Type** dropdown menu.

Other child states that share the same parent state will be automatically set as parallel states.
