# Parallel states

<!-- deps: ["states", "hierarchical-states"] -->

A parallel state is a state where all of its child states, also known as regions, are active simultaneously. The regions are separated inside the state container by a dashed line.

Inside the **on a walk** state, there could be two regions. One region contains the dog’s activity child states of **walking**, **running** and **stopping to sniff good smells**, and the other region contains the dog’s tail states of **wagging** and **not wagging**. The dog can walk and wag its tail, run and wag its tail or stop and sniff while wagging its tail; it can also do any of these activities without wagging its tail.

Both regions should also specify which child state is the initial state. In our **tail** region, the initial state is **not wagging**.

You can specify a parallel state node on the machine and/or any nested compound state by setting `type: 'parallel'`.

For example, the machine below allows the `upload` and `download` compound states to be simultaneously active. This example represents an application where you can download and upload files at the same time:

```ts twoslash {4,6,22}
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const fileMachine = createMachine({
  type: 'parallel',
  states: {
    upload: {
      initial: 'idle',
      states: {
        idle: {
          on: {
            INIT_UPLOAD: { target: 'pending' },
          },
        },
        pending: {
          on: {
            UPLOAD_COMPLETE: { target: 'success' },
          },
        },
        success: {},
      },
    },
    download: {
      initial: 'idle',
      states: {
        idle: {
          on: {
            INIT_DOWNLOAD: { target: 'pending' },
          },
        },
        pending: {
          on: {
            DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE: { target: 'success' },
          },
        },
        success: {},
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Parallel states allow you to run processes _simultaneously_ for greater flexibility and power.

## Matching parallel states

<!-- deps: ["intro-to-state-api","hierarchical-states","parallel-states"] -->

The `state.matches` syntax checks if an actor is in a particular state when the machine is run using `interpret` or similar. You can use `state.matches` with hierarchical states using either the string method or the object method.

### `state.matches` string argument

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({});
const state = machine.initialState;

// ---cut---
/**
 * Checks if the machine is in the red.stop
 * state
 */
console.log(state.matches('red.stop'));
```

### `state.matches` object argument

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({});
const state = machine.initialState;

// ---cut---
/**
 * Checks if the machine is in the red.stop
 * state
 */
state.matches({
  red: 'stop',
});
```

You can also use the object method to check if your machine is in two parallel states at once:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({});
const state = machine.initialState;

// ---cut---
/**
 * Checks if the machine is in the wind.blowing
 * state AND the rain.raining state
 */
state.matches({
  wind: 'blowing',
  rain: 'raining',
});
```

### Match one of multiple states

If you want to match one of multiple states, you can use [`.some()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some) on an array of state values:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({});
const state = machine.initialState;

// ---cut---
const isMatch = [{ customer: 'deposit' }, { customer: 'withdrawal' }].some(
  state.matches
);
```

## Targeting multiple parallel states

<!-- deps: ["parallel-states","transitions-and-events","targeting-children"] -->

Sometimes you’ll need a transition to target multiple parts of a parallel state simultaneously. This is useful when you want to affect different parts of a simultaneous process at the same time.

Multiple targets are specified as an array in `target: [...]`.

```ts twoslash {24-26}
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const settingsMachine = createMachine({
  type: 'parallel',
  states: {
    mode: {
      initial: 'active',
      states: {
        inactive: {},
        pending: {},
        active: {},
      },
    },
    status: {
      initial: 'enabled',
      states: {
        disabled: {},
        enabled: {},
      },
    },
  },
  on: {
    // Multiple targets
    DEACTIVATE: {
      target: ['.mode.inactive', '.status.disabled'],
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, the `DEACTIVATE` event simultaneously causes _two_ changes, disabling the `status` and turning the `mode` to `inactive`.

## Final states and parallel states

<!-- deps: ["parallel-states", "state-done-events"] -->

When every child state node in a parallel state node is _done_, the parent parallel state node is also _done_. When every final state node in every child compound node is reached, the `done` event will be fired for the parallel state node.

`onDone` is very useful in modeling parallel tasks. For example, below there is a shopping machine where `user` and `items` represent two parallel tasks of the `cart` state:

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const shoppingMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'cart',
  states: {
    cart: {
      type: 'parallel',
      states: {
        user: {
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              entry: 'getUser',
              on: {
                RESOLVE_USER: { target: 'success' },
                REJECT_USER: { target: 'failure' },
              },
            },
            success: { type: 'final' },
            failure: {},
          },
        },
        items: {
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              entry: 'getItems',
              on: {
                RESOLVE_ITEMS: { target: 'success' },
                REJECT_ITEMS: { target: 'failure' },
              },
            },
            success: { type: 'final' },
            failure: {},
          },
        },
      },
      onDone: 'confirm',
    },
    confirm: {},
  },
});
```

The `onDone` transition will only happen when all of the child states of `cart` (e.g., `user` and `items`) are in their final states. In the case of the shopping machine, once the `shopping.cart.user.success` and `shopping.cart.items.success` state nodes are reached, the machine will transition from the `cart` to the `confirm` state.
