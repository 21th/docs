# Live Simulation Mode

Forget screen sharing, there’s live simulation mode! Let’s say you’re working on the application logic and want a second opinion or to share your machine with your team mates, live simulation has made this process as easy as sharing a link. It is not necessary to take screenshots anymore because this feature will let all users with the specially generated link to access and discuss in real time the process of your machine.

In order to use this collaborative feature, the user initiating the live simulation must be signed in. When looking at the Stately Studio, you’re able to switch between two views: Design mode and Simulate mode.

:::studio

Live simulation is a Pro feature of the Studio. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or [upgrade to try the Pro plan with a 30-day free trial](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Simulate your machine with others

1. Select the **Simulate** mode from the center of the visual editor. When in the **Simulate** mode, you’ll see your machine with the initial state turn the color blue. Blue means your machine is not currently being edited or shared, but you are simulating the logic flow of the current machine. In **Simulate** mode, this is where you can go through each state and transition to thoroughly review your logic.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/live-sim/live-sim-menu.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/live-sim/live-sim-menu-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

2. While in **Simulate** mode, you’ll notice a button **Live mode** on the bottom left corner. When clicking the **Live mode** button, you’ll have the options: 
- **Join a Live simulation** session.
- **Start a live simulation** session.

:::tip

The **Live mode** button will only be displayed when you are using the Simulate mode in the Studio. To know if you’re in the Simulate mode, you’ll see your states and transitions light up in blue color.

3. When selecting the option **Start a live simulation**, you’ll notice the machine is orange. Then, the bottom left corner will show **Copy link** or **Stop** buttons, along with a 6 character code (for example: 3KNYII). 
You can share your machine when in Live simulation mode by selecting the option **copy link** and then a toast will pop up to confirm the link was copied to your clipboard. Go ahead and share that link to other participants! 
The link can also be accessed by users who are not logged in to the Studio.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/live-sim/live-sim-start-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

:::tip

To recognize you’re in a Live simulation mode, you’ll notice the blue states have now transitioned to orange.

4. When selecting the option **Join a Live simulation**, you’ll be prompted to enter a code to reference which machine simulation session you’ll be joining.
If you were given a link to join the Live simulation session, you would only need to copy and paste that link into your browser.
The two buttons that pop up are to **Cancel** or **Join**, when you have joined a Live simulation session.

### Benefits

Being able to have live participants and discussions while simulating the logic flow of your application is so important. How would you know if everyone is on the same page, unless there’s a visual diagram to guide each process in a machine? 
With Live Simulation mode, each user with the machine link can provide valuable feedback on how the machine is accurately representing the logic or is missing some states that can be easily added in using the Design mode of the Studio.

Testing your application logic, collaboratively is very powerful.
Each participant is able to interact with the machine, while other members with the shared link are able to see in real time, which part of the machine is being discussed in detail. With screen sharing, we risk having low quality images, small fonts, or pixelated text, and only one user has control over the machine at a time. Live Simulation mode is an easy solution for all of your team, whether they have a technical background or not. 
Live Simulation mode is just the beginning or our collaborative features. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback, please submit them to [feedback.stately.ai](https://feedback.stately.ai/) 

Happy Modeling!
