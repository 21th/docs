# Live Simulation Mode

Live simulation mode helps you share your simulated machine with your team without screen sharing or screenshots. Share the generated live simulation link, and your team can view your simulation in real-time and even trigger events themselves.

:::studio

Live simulation is a Pro feature of the Studio. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or [upgrade to try the Pro plan with a 30-day free trial](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Simulate your machine with others

In order to use this collaborative feature, the user initiating the live simulation must be signed in. When looking at the Stately Studio, you’re able to switch between two views: Design mode and Simulate mode.

1. Select the **Simulate** mode from the center of the visual editor. 

:::tip

When you’re in **Simulate** mode, your current state and next available events are highlighted in blue to simulate the flow of your machine. Click the available events to transition through states and review your logic.

2. Use the **Live mode** button in the bottom left corner to reveal the **Live simulation** options.

  }}
/>
</p>

2. While in **Simulate** mode, you’ll notice a button **Live mode** on the bottom left corner. When clicking the **Live mode** button, you’ll have the options: 
- **Join a Live simulation** session.
- **Start a live simulation** session.

3. Choose **Start a live simulation** to start simulation your machine.

When your machine is in live simulation mode, the **Live simulation panel** will display in the bottom left corner with a six-character unique code (for example: 3KNYII) along with **Copy link** and **Stop** buttons. The highlighted current state and next events will also be highlighted in orange.
3. When selecting the option **Start a live simulation**, you’ll notice the machine is orange. Then, the bottom left corner will show **Copy link** or **Stop** buttons, along with a 6 character code (for example: 3KNYII). 
You can share your machine when in Live simulation mode by selecting the option **copy link** and then a toast will pop up to confirm the link was copied to your clipboard. Go ahead and share that link to other participants! 
The link can also be accessed by users who are not logged in to the Studio.

4. When selecting the option **Join a Live simulation**, you’ll be prompted to enter a code to reference which machine simulation session you’ll be joining.
If you were given a link to join the Live simulation session, you would only need to copy and paste that link into your browser.
4. Choose **Join a Live simulation** to join an existing live simulation mode session.
5. Enter the unique session mode code you’ve been provided.
