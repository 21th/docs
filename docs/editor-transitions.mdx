title: Using transitions and events in Stately’s editor
---

A [**transition**](transitions.mdx) is a change from one finite state to another, triggered by an event.

An **event** is a signal, trigger, or message that causes a transition. When an actor receives an event, its machine will determine if there are any enabled transitions for that event in the current state. If enabled transitions exist, the machine will take them and execute their actions.

The arrows are transitions, and the rounded rectangles on the arrow’s lines are events. Each transition has a **source** state which comes before the transition, and a **target** state, which comes after the transition. The transition’s arrow starts from the source state and points to the target state.

## Add a transition and event

1. Select an existing state.
2. Press or drag from one of the <Plus size={18} /> handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.

## Change the source and target states for a transition or event

First select the transition or event you want to change. Then…

- On the canvas, right-click the transition or event, or use the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot icon button, to open the Edit menu and choose **Switch source and target**.
- Drag the transition’s handle connected to the state to connect it to a new state.
- Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu. Choose a new source state from the **Source** dropdown options and a new target state from the **Target** dropdown options.
