# Stately Studio

The Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic.

<!-- TODO: screenshot of the studio -->

## Visual editor

The visual editor supports everything you need to build state machines and statecharts. The editor currently has two modes:

### Editor mode

Visually add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data including actions, descriptions, and invoked actors.

### Simulation mode

Run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

### Export

You can also **export machines to JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript**, ready to be used in your codebase with XState.

:::caution

Don’t confuse our visual editor with our [previous visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz), known as the Stately Viz. The Viz works well and has many valuable features, but it doesn’t have many of the best features of our visual editor, including drag-and-drop, descriptions, and XXX.
