# Welcome to the Stately Studio docs

The Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic, including the Studio Editor, [developer tools for XState](/tools/developer-tools), and more coming soon. 

You can use the [Studio Editor](#studio-editor) to visually model your logic using state machines and statecharts, no code required! Collaborate on your machines with coworkers and friends with [shared projects in teams](#projects-and-teams). Use the [XState VS Code extension](/tools/developer-tools) to use the Editor with your codebase inside your code editor, or [export](#export) your code from the Studio into your codebase.

What are state machines and statecharts? We’re glad you asked! [Check out our no-code introduction to state machines and statecharts](/state-machines-and-statecharts).

## Studio Editor

The Studio Editor supports everything you need to build state machines and statecharts visually. The Editor currently has two modes; editor mode for creating your machines, and simulation mode for simulating how your machine works.

### Editor mode

Visually add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data including actions, descriptions, and invoked actors.

### Simulation mode

Run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

### Export

You can also **export machines to JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript**, ready to be used in your codebase with [XState](/xstate/intro).

## Projects and teams

## Discover machines

Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn from how somebody else models their machines?  The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created with the Stately Studio. [Read more about the Discover page](/discover).

## Our roadmap

Do you want to request a feature in the Stately Studio? [Check out our Canny roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.io) to post your feature idea and upvote other features. Our roadmap also shows you the features we have planned, and those that are already in progress.

You can also keep up with the Stately team’s work in progress at our regular [office hour livestreams](https://youtube.com/statelyai).

## Powered by XState

The Stately Studio is powered by [XState](/xstate/installation), a best-in-class open source library for handling complexity at scale.
