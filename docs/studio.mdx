# Welcome to the Stately docs

Welcome to the Stately docs! Here you can find all the documentation for the Stately Studio and [XState](/xstate). There are a few ways you might want to get started:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è Keep reading to [find out more about the Studio Editor](#studio-editor).
- üèÅ Jump straight into [learning how to use the Editor, starting with states](/states/intro).
- üß† Learn about [state machines and statecharts in our no-code introduction](/state-machines-and-statecharts).
- üíª Get started with [XState, our JavaScript and TypeScript library for state machines and statecharts](/xstate/intro).

The Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic, including the Studio Editor, [developer tools for XState](/tools/developer-tools), and much more coming soon. 

<!-- TODO: screenshot of the studio -->

You can use the [Studio Editor](#studio-editor) to model your logic using state machines and statecharts visually; no code required! Collaborate on your machines with coworkers and friends with [shared projects in teams](#projects-and-teams). Use the [XState VS Code extension](/tools/developer-tools) to use the Editor with your codebase inside your code editor, or [export](#export) your code from the Studio into your codebase.

What are state machines and statecharts? We‚Äôre glad you asked! [Check out our no-code introduction to state machines and statecharts](/state-machines-and-statecharts).

## Studio Editor

The Studio Editor supports everything you need to visually build state machines and statecharts. The Editor currently has two modes; editor mode for creating your machines and simulation mode for simulating how your machine works.

### Editor mode

<!-- TODO: screenshot of editor mode -->

Visually add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data, including actions, descriptions, and invoked actors.

### Simulation mode

<!-- TODO: screenshot of the simulation mode -->

Run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

### Export

You can also export machines to JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript, ready to be used in your codebase with [XState](/xstate/intro).

## Projects and teams

<!-- TODO: screenshot of the projects -->

As a [Professional user](https://stately.ai/pricing), you can create and join teams in the Stately Studio to share your machines and collaborate on private team projects. [Read more about Projects](/projects) and [Teams](/teams).

## Discover machines

Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn from how somebody else models their machines?  The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created with the Stately Studio. [Read more about the Discover page](/discover).
