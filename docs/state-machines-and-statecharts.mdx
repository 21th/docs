title: What are state machines and statecharts?
---

State machines help us model how a process goes from state to state when an event occurs.

State machines are useful in software development because they help us capture all the states, events and transitions between them. Using state machines makes it easier to find impossible states and spot undesirable transitions.

State machines model your application logic. Below is the logic for a video player. When the video is Played, it is opened into fullscreen mode. When the video is stopped, it closes out of fullscreen mode. When the video player is in fullscreen mode, it can be _Playing_ or _Paused_.

![Video player state machine containing closed and opened states. On the Play event, the Closed state transitions to the Opened state. The Opened state invokes a startVideo actor and has a description of “The video player should be in full-screen mode.” The Opened state contains Playing and Paused states, which are transitioned between using the Pause and Play events. There’s a Stop event from the Opened state that transitions to the final state of Stopped. There’s a delayed transition from the Stopped state back to the Closed state after 5 seconds.](TODO:)

## What is a statechart?

Statecharts are fancy state machines used to model more complex logic.

Statecharts are a visual extension to state machines that use boxes and arrows, much like flowcharts and sequence diagrams. Statecharts add extra features not available in ordinary state machines, including  [hierarchy](/states/parent-states), [concurrency](/states/parallel-states) and [communication](/actions-and-actors/actors).

When you make a state machine in the [Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/editor), it’s also a statechart!

## States

A state describes the machine’s status or mode, which could be as simple as *Asleep* and *Awake*. A state machine can only be in one state at a time.

A dog is always **asleep** or **awake**. The dog can’t be asleep and awake at the same time, and it’s impossible for the dog to be neither asleep nor awake. There are only these two states, a precisely limited, _finite_ number of states.

The rounded rectangle boxes are states. [Read how to create states in the Stately Studio](/states/intro).

### Initial state

When a state machine starts, it enters the **initial state** first. A machine can only have one top-level initial state; if there were multiple initial states, the machine wouldn’t know where to start!

In a statechart describing the process of walking the dog, the initial state would be **waiting** to walk:

The filled circle with an arrow icon represents the initial state. [Read how to create initial states in the Stately Studio](/states/initial-states).

## Events and transitions

A machine moves from state to state through **transitions**. Events cause transitions; when an event happens, the machine transitions to the next state. The dog goes between **asleep** and **awake** through the **wake up** and **fall asleep** events.

Transitions are “deterministic”; each combination of state and event always points to the same next state. Dogs never **wake up** to become **asleep** or **fall asleep** to become **awake**.

With its two finite states and transitions, this tiny dog process is a _Finite State Machine._ A state machine is used to describe the behavior of something. The machine describes the thing’s states and the transitions between those states. It’s a Finite State Machine because it has a finite number of states. (Sometimes abbreviated to FSM by folks who love jargon).

### Events and transitions in the Stately Studio

In the Stately Studio, the arrows are transitions, and the rounded rectangles on the arrow’s lines are events. Each transition has a **source** state which comes before the transition, and a **target** state, which comes after the transition. The transition’s arrow starts from the source state and points to the target state. [Read how to create events and transitions in the Stately Studio](/transitions-and-events/intro).
