title: Guards
---

A **guard** is a condition that the machine checks when it goes through an event. If the condition is true, the machine follows the transition to the next state. If the condition is false, the machine follows the rest of the conditions to the next state. Any transition can be a guarded transition.

Guards are numbered in the order they are checked and labeled with “if” or “elseif” along with their condition. Multiple guards on the same events are connected with a dotted line.

[TODO: Why you might use a guard with example.]
