title: Delayed (after) transitions
---

**Delayed transitions** are transitions that only happen after a specified interval of time. If another event happens before the end of the timer, the transition doesn’t complete.

Delayed transitions are labeled “after” and often referred to as “after” transitions.

In a video player, we might want the video to be *Closed* out of fullscreen mode a few seconds after the video has *Stopped*, instead of closing the fullscreen mode suddenly as soon as the video is stopped. The eventless transition above transitions from the *Stopped* state to the *Closed* state after 5 seconds.

### How to make an event into a delayed transition

First, select the event you want to replace with a delayed transition. Then…

#### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the event to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **After** from the **Event type** options.
3. Use the **Transition details** panel to change the delay time.

#### Using the **Transition details** panel

1. Open the **Transition details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Choose **After** from the **Event type** dropdown menu.
3. Specify the delay time in milliseconds using the **Delay** text input.

Delayed transitions are handy if you need to build timeouts and intervals into your application logic.
