When you run a statechart, it becomes an actor; a running process that can receive messages, send messages and change its behavior based on the messages it receives, which can cause effects outside of the actor.

An invoked actor is an actor that can execute its own actions and communicate with the machine. These invoked actors are started in a state and stopped when the state is exited.

Invoked actors are often referred to as “invocations.” They are labeled on their invoking state with “Invoke /” followed by the actor’s source name and ID.

You can invoke multiple actors on a single state. Final states cannot have invoked actors.

In the video player above, the *startVideo* actor is invoked when the video player is in the *Opened* state.

### How to invoke actors on a state

1. Select the state you want to invoke an actor.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Use the **+** icon alongside the **Invocations** to add a new action.
4. Add the source for the actor using the **src** text input.
5. Add the ID for the actor using the **ID** text input.
6. Save the invoked actor using the **Save** button.
