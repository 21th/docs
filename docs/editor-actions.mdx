## Add custom or built-in actions

:::studio

When you create an action in the Stately editor, it is a custom action by default. You can edit your actions to use XState’s built-in actions.

:::

Custom actions with a custom action type and parameters which will be formatted as [XState action objects](actions.mdx#action-objects) in your [exported code](export-as-code.mdx).

Built-in XState actions will be formatted in your [exported code](export-as-code.mdx). The options are:

- [assign](actions.mdx#assign-action): assigns data to the state context.
- [raise](actions.mdx#raise-action): _raises_ an event that is received by the same machine.
- [log](actions.mdx#log-action): an easy way to log messages to the console.
- [sendTo](actions.mdx#send-to-action): sends an event to a specific actor.
- [stop](actions.mdx#stop-action): stops a child actor.
