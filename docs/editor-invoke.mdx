title: 'Invoked actors in Stately’s editor'

XState is based on the [actor model](actors.mdx). [Invoked actors](invoke.mdx) are managed by the state machine. Invoked actors are created and started when the state is entered, and stopped when the state is exited.

You can invoke multiple actors on a single state. Top-level final states cannot have invoked actors.

In the video player above, the *startVideo* actor is invoked when the video player is in the *Opened* state.

## Invoke actors on a state

First, select the state where you want to invoke an actor.

### On the canvas

1. Select the state where you want to invoke an actor.
2. Use the <Plus size={18} /> plus icon button to open the edit menu.
3. Choose **Invoked actor** from the menu to add an invoked actor block to the event.
4. Write your actor’s source in the invoked actors’s text input.

### Add actor source logic and ID

1. Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Invoked actor** panel.
2. Enter the actor’s source logic in the **Source logic** text input.
3. Enter the actor’s ID in the **Actor ID** text input.

### Using the event details panel

1. Select the state where you want to invoke an actor.
2. Open the state <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Use the **+ Effect** button to open the effects menu, and choose **Add invoked actor**.
4. Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Invoked actor** panel.
5. Enter the actor’s source logic in the **Source logic** text input.
6. Enter the actor’s ID in the **Actor ID** text input.

## Invoke done and invoke error events

- An **invoke done event** transitions from a state once its invocation has been completed. An invoke done event is labeled “done:” followed by the invocation’s ID.
- An **invoke error event** transitions from a state when an error occurs in its invocation. An invoke error event is labeled “error:” followed by the invocation’s ID.

### How to create invoke done and invoke error events in Stately’s editor

1. Select the state with an invoked actor where you want to add an invoke done and invoke error events.
2. Press or drag from one of the <Plus size={18} /> handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state. The newly-created event will automatically be created as an invoke done event.
3. Again, press or drag from one of the <Plus size={18} /> handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state. This next newly-created event will automatically be created as an invoke error event.

You can also change an existing event into an invoke done or invoke error event using the edit menu. The source state must have an invoked actor.

1. Select the existing event you wish to change into an invoke done or invoke error event.
2. Right-click the state to open the edit menu.
3. From the **Event type** options, choose **Invocation done event** or **Invocation error event**.
