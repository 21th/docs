# Built-in actions

Along with `assign`, XState has several other built-in actions which can do different things in a state machine. Weâ€™ll introduce a couple of built-in actions for now and learn about the others later.

## Send action

import SendAction from '../_modules/send-action.mdx';

<SendAction />;

## Pure action

import PureAction from '../_modules/pure-action.mdx';

<PureAction />;

## Rules of built-in actions

import BuiltInActionsRules from '../_modules/built-in-actions-rules.mdx';

<BuiltInActionsRules />;

## Summary

`send` can be used to send events back to your machine. `pure` can be used to dynamically return different actions. Built-in actions must be passed directly to the machine or returned from `pure`.
