# Actions

import Actions from '../_modules/actions.mdx';

<Actions />;

## Actions on self-transitions

import SelfTransitions from '../_modules/self-transitions.mdx';

<SelfTransitions />;

## Summary

You can run actions on `entry` to a state, `exit` from a state, or on a transition. Self-transitions are particularly useful if you want to run an action without leaving the state.

Next, weâ€™ll look at using actions to store arbitrary values in your state machine via [context](/actions/context).
