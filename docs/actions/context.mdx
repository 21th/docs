## Summary

`States` are used for handling your apps states which you know about in advance. `Context` is a data store that you can use to store any arbitrary values. `assign` can be used to assign values to the context, and the context can be used in any action you call.

Next, weâ€™ll look at some [special built-in actions](/actions/built-in-actions) XState provides to extend its powers.
