## Summary

A statechart turns boxes and arrows into executable code. The “boxes” are states—the different modes your app can be in. The “arrows” are transitions, letting your statechart know how to move from state to state. Events sent to the statechart can trigger transitions and also pass values to the statechart.

Next, we’ll learn how to make a statechart execute side effects with [Options](/basics/options).
