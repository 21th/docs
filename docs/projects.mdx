A project is a collection of machines that helps you organize your personal machines and collaborate with others on your application logic.

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

You can access your projects from **My Projects** at the left of the Studio’s top bar when you’re signed into the Stately Studio. **My Projects** lists your personal projects and is one of the locations where you can create new projects.

When you select a project, the first machine in the project will open in the visual editor. The other machines in your project are accessible from the **Machines** list in the left drawer menu.
