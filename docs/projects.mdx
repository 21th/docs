A project is a collection of machines that helps you organize your personal machines and collaborate with others on your application logic.

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

You can access your projects from **My Projects** at the left of the Studio’s top bar when you’re signed into the Stately Studio. **My Projects** lists your personal projects and is one of the locations where you can create new projects.

When you select a project, the first machine in the project will open in the Studio Editor. The other machines in your project are accessible from the **Machines** list in the left drawer menu.

### Shared projects

Shared projects are available to [Teams](/teams). Team projects are listed inside their Team in the Stately Studio workspace.

### Change a project’s visibility

A project can be **public**, **unlisted**, or **private**. If the project is a shared team project, only team members with the **Owner** or **Admin** roles can change its visibility.

- Public projects are visible to everyone. They are discoverable on the [Discover](/discover) page and listed on your profile page.
- Unlisted projects are visible to everyone with the project’s URL but are not findable on the Discover page or listed on your profile page.
- Private projects are only visible to you and the team that owns the project.

2. Toggle the project’s visibility between **public**, **unlisted**, or **private** from the dropdown menu in the Share dialog.
