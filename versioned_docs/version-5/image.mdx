title: Machine images
---

You can share an image of your machine anywhere that supports images. The image URL can be used for live-updating images where the machine is always up to date with your latest changes.

Your machine image will only be available if:

- the project visibility is **public**
- the project visibility is **unlisted**

Machine images are not available for private machines.

Read [how to change a project’s visibility settings](projects.mdx#change-a-projects-visibility).

:::tip

You can also [embed your machine](embed.mdx) for a focused non-editable view of your machine in Stately Studio’s editor.

1. Open the **Machines** list from the left drawer menu.
2. Use the **...** triple dot icon alongside your machine name to open the machine options menu.
3. Use the **Import Code** option to open the import text area.
