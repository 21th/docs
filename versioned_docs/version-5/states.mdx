A state describes the machine’s status or mode, which could be as simple as *Paused* and *Playing*. A state machine can only be in one state at a time.

[View this machine in the Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/registry/editor/e13bef2b-bb13-4465-96ac-0bc25340688e?machineId=741f69fd-7f01-4932-9407-6871e225bb6d).

:::studio

In the Stately Studio, the rounded rectangle boxes are states. The **?** question mark icon in the machine above indicates an unreachable state. The state is unreachable because it isn’t connected to the [initial state](initial-states.mdx) by a [transition](events.mdx).

:::

These states are “finite”; the machine can only move through the states you’ve pre-defined.

## Using states in the Studio

### Create a state

1. Select your machine or an existing state.
2. Create a new state inside your machine or existing state:
   - Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state, or:
   - Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
   - Double-click inside your machine or an existing state.

## State object

- Accessed from `actor.subscribe(state => ...)` and `actor.getSnapshot()`
- Can be accessed from `machine.transition(state, event)` return value
- Contains `value` and `context`

Properties

- `value` is object representation of all active state nodes
- `context` is the other data that is relevant to the state
- `meta`
- `output`

## State value

## State context

## `state.can(eventType)`

## `state.hasTag(tag)`

## `state.matches(stateValue)`

- Prefer `state.hasTag(tag)`

## `state.output`

## `state.nextEvents`

## `state.meta`

## `state.toStrings`
