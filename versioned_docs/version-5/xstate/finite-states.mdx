# Finite states

A finite state is one of the possible states that a state machine can be in at any given time. It's called "finite" because there should be a limited number of possible states that the machine can be in. Finite states define how a machine "behaves" when in a state; e.g. a status or a mode. They represent how a machine "behaves" when in a state; e.g. a status or a mode; a machine can behave differently depending what state it is in.

- states with same key

<!-- TODO: image -->

For example in a feedback form, you can be in a state where you are filling out the form, or a state where the form is being submitted. You cannot be filling out the form and submitting it at the same time; this is an "impossible state".

State machines always start at an **initial state**.

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'feedback',

  // Initial state
  initial: 'prompt',

  // Finite states
  states: {
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    form: {
      /* ... */
    },
    thanks: {
      /* ... */
    },
    closed: {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
});
```

You can combine finite states with [context](TODO), which make up the overall state of a machine:

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'feedback',
  context: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    feedback: '',
  },

  initial: 'prompt',
  states: {
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
});
```

<!-- TODO: `.getSnapshot()` and show `.value` and `.context` -->

## Initial state

The initial state is the state that the machine starts in. It is defined by the `initial` property on the machine config:

<!-- TODO: example -->

The initial state can be represented by an object with a `target` and optionally `actions`:

<!-- TODO: example -->

<!-- TODO: link to actions -->

### Editor: create initial state

## Transitions

Transitions are how you move from one state to another. They are defined by the `on` property on a state node:

<!-- TODO: example (longhand `target:` syntax) -->

<!-- TODO: link to transitions -->

### Editor: create transition

## Final states

A final state is a state that represents the completion or successful termination of a machine. It is defined by the `type: 'final'` property on a state node:

<!-- TODO: example -->

- A machine can have zero or more final states
- Final states can have output
- Machine terminates when it reaches a final state (explain what this means)

<!-- TODO: link to final states section -->

### Editor: create final state

## Identifying states

States can be identified with a unique ID: `id: 'myState'`. This is useful for targeting a state from any other state (link to transitions)

- Does not affect the `state.value`

## Other state types

In statecharts, there are other types of states:

- Compound states (link)
- Parallel states (link)
- History states (link)
- Final states (link)
