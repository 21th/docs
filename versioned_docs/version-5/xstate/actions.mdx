# Actions

<!-- TODO: add link below -->

Actions are effects that are executed due to a [transition](#). Actions are fire-and-forget effects; that is, they are not awaited, and they don't return anything to the state machine.

Examples of actions:

- Logging a message
- Sending a message to another actor
- TODO: more examples

Actions are represented on transitions in `actions: ...` property, and can be a single action or an array.

They can also be on states `entry` or `exit`, also as single or array.

<!-- TODO: simple example -->

## Inline actions

Useful for prototyping and simple cases. It's recommended to serialize them instead.

<!-- TODO: `{ actions: () => { ... } } -->

## Action objects

They have a `type` and optional `params`.

<!-- TODO: parameterized action -->

## Implementing actions

Actions are implemented with `.provide(...)`

<!-- TODO: `.provide({ actions })` -->

- Show how `params` can be used in implementation

From there, you can read `{ action }` object, which has `type` and `params`

## Entry and exit actions

Entry actions = actions that occur on any transition that enters a state node

<!-- TODO: illustation -->

Exit actions = actions that occur on any transition that exits a state node

<!-- TODO: illustration -->

Entry and exit actions are defined on `entry: ...` and `exit: ...` of state node.

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Assign action

Assign action is a special action that assigns data to the state context. Special action

Can assign per property: `assign({ foo: 'bar' })` or overall: `assign(() => ({ foo: 'bar' }))`

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Raise action

Raise action is a special action that raises an event. A **raised event** is an event that the machine creates and sends to itself.

<!-- TODO: example -->

Raised events can be dynamic: `raise(({ context, event }) => ({ type: 'SOME_EVENT' }))`

## Send-to action

The `sendTo(...)` action is a special action that sends an event to a specific actor.

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Pure action

A pure action is a higher-level action that returns an array of actions to be executed, without actually executing any effects (hence the name "pure").

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Log action

A log action is an easy way to log messages to the console.

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Choose action

A choose action is a higher-level action that returns an array of actions to be executed.

<!-- TODO: example -->

## Shorthands

For simple actions, can specify action string instead of object
