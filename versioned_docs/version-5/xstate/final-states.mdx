# Final states

A final state is a state that represents the completion or successful termination of a machine. It is defined by the `type: 'final'` property on a state node:

```ts
import { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate';

const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'prompt',
  states: {
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    thanks: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // highlight-start
    closed: {
      type: 'final',
    },
    // highlight-end
    // ...
  },
  on: {
    'feedback.close': {
      target: '.closed',
    },
  },
});
```

- A state machine can have zero or more final states. Some machines may run indefinitely and not need to terminate.
- Final states can have `output` data, which is sent to the parent machine when the machine terminates.
- When a machine reaches a top-level final state, it terminates.

## Top-level final states

A top-level final state is a final state that is a direct child state of the machine. When the machine reaches a top-level final state, the machine will terminate. When a machine terminates, it can no longer receive events nor transition.

## Child final states

When a child final state of a compound state is reached, that compound state is considered "done". The `onDone` transition of that compound state is taken.

## Final states in parallel states

When all regions of a parallel state are "done", the parallel state is considered "done". The `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken.
