XState is a state management & orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.

It uses event-driven programming, state machines, statecharts, and the actor model to handle complex logic in predictable, robust, and visual ways. XState can be used in any framework and in the frontend, backend, or anywhere else JavaScript runs.

## Installation

XState is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xstate):

```bash
# npm
npm install xstate

# yarn
yarn add xstate
```

## Create a machine

```js
import { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate';

const countMachine = createMachine({
  context: {
    count: 0,
  },
  on: {
    INC: {
      actions: assign({
        count: (context) => context.count + 1,
      }),
    },
    DEC: {
      actions: assign({
        count: (context) => context.count - 1,
      }),
    },
    SET: {
      actions: assign({
        count: (_, event) => event.value,
      }),
    },
  },
});

const countActor = interpret(countMachine).start();

countActor.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log(state.context.count);
});

countActor.send({ type: 'INC' }); // logs 1

countActor.send({ type: 'DEC' }); // logs 0

countActor.send({ type: 'SET', value: 10 }); // logs 10
```
