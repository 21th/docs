# Delayed transitions (after)

Delayed transitions are taken after a set amount of time. They are defined on the `after` property:

<!-- TODO: `{ after: ... }` -->

## Stately Editor: delayed transitions

## Delays

- Delays can be inlined as number, e.g. `after: { 1000: ... }`
- Delays can be referenced; e.g. `after: { timeout: ... }`
- `.provide({ delays })`
- Can be defined as expression: `after: [{ delay: () => 1000, target: ... }]`

## Delay references

```ts
createMachine({
  after: {
    DELAY: {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
}).provide({
  delays: {
    DELAY: 1000, // or expression
  },
});
```
