# History states

A history state is a special type of state (a _pseudostate_) that remembers the last [child state](#) that was active before its parent state is exited. When a transition from outside the parent state targets a history state, the remembered child state is entered.

Essentially, this allows statecharts to "remember" where they left off when exiting and reentering a state.

- If no child state remembered, history goes to `.target` state, if it is specified
- Otherwise, go to [initial state](#)

## Shallow vs. deep history

- Shallow history states only remember the last active direct child state.
- Deep history states remember all active descendant states.

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: 'firstState',
  states: {
    hist: {
      type: 'history',
      history: 'deep', // or 'shallow' (default)
      target: 'someState', // optional
    },
    firstState: {},
    someState: {},
    anotherState: {},
  },
});
```
