# Node

When running machines in Node, a few common patterns emerge.

## Long-running processes

The first pattern is running XState to coordinate a long-running process, for instance, a file watcher in a CLI (Command Line Interface):

```ts twoslash
import { interpret, createMachine } from "xstate";
import { watch } from "chokidar";

const machine = createMachine({
  initial: "waitingForChokidarToBeReady",
  states: {
    waitingForChokidarToBeReady: {
      on: {
        CHOKIDAR_READY: {
          target: "chokidarReady",
        },
      },
    },
    chokidarReady: {
      entry: () => {
        console.log("Chokidar Ready!");
      },
    },
  },
});

const main = () => {
  const actor = interpret(machine).start();

  watch("./**").on("ready", () => {
    actor.send("CHOKIDAR_READY");
  });
};

main();
```

In the script above, we run our main actor by calling `interpret().start()` on the `machine`. We use [`chokidar`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar), a file watcher, to watch over a set of files and then report that the watcher is ready to the actor. The actor then logs a message to the console.

XState is extremely powerful at managing long-running processes like this, where multiple event sources need to be coordinated. You could even extend the example above to handle a process, which [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) does for its build processing.
