import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

States can contain more states, also known as **child states**. These child states are only active when the parent state is active.

Child states are nested inside their parent states. Parent states are also known as **compound states**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Video player state machine containing closed and opened states. On the Play event, the Closed state transitions to the Opened state. The Opened state invokes a startVideo actor and has a description of “The video player should be in full-screen mode.” The Opened state contains Playing and Paused states, which are transitioned between using the Pause and Play events. There’s a Stop event from the Opened state that transitions to the final state of Stopped. There’s a delayed transition from the Stopped state back to the Closed state after 5 seconds."

[View this machine in Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/registry/editor/e13bef2b-bb13-4465-96ac-0bc25340688e?machineId=9ba5377c-aab3-4465-8909-4eea499622fa).

In the video player above, the *Opened* state is a parent state to the *Playing*, *Paused*, and *Stopped* states. These states, their transitions, and their events are nested inside the *Opened* state.

## Add a child state

First, select your machine or an existing state where you want to create the child state. Then…

- Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state to create a nested child state. Or…
- If a state already contains child states, you can double-click inside the parent state to create another child state.

## Change the parent state of a child state

Using the **State details** panel:

1. Select the child state you want to reparent.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose your desired new parent from the **Parent** dropdown menu.
