TODO

- What is persistence/restoration?
- Why is it useful?
  - Frontend use-case
  - Backend use-case

## Persisting state

- `actor.getPersistedState()`
- With machines
- Other actors can persist state too

## Restoring state

- `interpret(behavior, { state: restoredState }).start()`
- Actions are not replayed
  - explain why (because they are already executed)
- Invocations are restarted

## Recursive persistence

- Invoked actors are persisted/restored recursively
- Spawned actors are persisted/restored recursively

## Strategies

- Storage
  - Localstorage
  - DB
  - Cookies
  - Filesystem
  - URL

# Caveats

- Incompatible state
- Desire to replay actions
- Consider [event sourcing](#)

# TypeScript

# Cheatsheet
