title: Eventless (always) transitions
---

**Eventless transitions** are transitions without events. These transitions are *always* taken after any transition in their state is enabled.

Eventless transitions are labeled “always” and often referred to as “always” transitions.

```ts
{
  states: {
    form: {
      initial: 'valid',
      states: {
        valid: {},
        invalid: {}
      },
      always: {
        guard: 'isValid',
        target: 'valid',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usign eventless transitions in the Studio

### Make an event into an eventless transition

First, select the event you want to replace with an eventless transition. Then…

#### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **Always** from the **Event type** options.

#### Using the **Transition details** panel

1. Open the **Transition details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Choose **Always** from the **Event type** dropdown menu.

In statecharts, an eventless transition is a transition that occurs without an explicit event. They are taken immediately after normal transitions are taken, if they are enabled (that is, if their guards are true (LINK)).

They are useful for doing things when some condition is true.

Warning: avoid infinite loops by using guards.
