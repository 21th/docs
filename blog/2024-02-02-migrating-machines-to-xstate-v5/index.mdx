We recently announced the recent release of XState v5! During its beta phase, we created a [migration guide](https://stately.ai/docs/migration), specifically to call out breaking changes and to give developers onging updates regarding api changes. This post is a walkthrough of migrating existing XState machines from v4 to v5 and is intended to be more of a step-by-step companion to the migration guide. It also focuses on migrating [XState machines that are using TypeScript](https://stately.ai/docs/typescript).

:::

We at Stately have dozens of XState machines in our own [Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/studio) code base and have been migrating those to XState v5 as well. We’ve learned a lot about the migration process and wanted to share some of the experience to make yours even smoother.

The following is a sequence of steps you can follow to migrate an existing XState v4 machine to XState v5. The order is merely a recommendation, not a requirement.

1. [Install XState v5 and dependencies](#1-install-xstate-v5-and-dependencies)
2. [Move types to `setup()` and remove typegen](#1-move-types-to-setup-and-remove-typegen)
3. [Convert action strings to parameterized actions](#3-convert-actions-strings-to-parameterized-actions)
4. [Include implementations or stubs to `setup()`](#4-move-implementations-or-stubs-to-setup)
5. [Provide concrete implementations](#5-provide-concrete-implementations)

### 1. Install XState v5 and dependencies

The first step will be to [install XState v5](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate#installation). You can also install library-specific dependencies if you're using XState with [React](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-react), [Vue](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-vue), or [Svelte](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-svelte).

If you have many state machines and would like to incrementally migrate those to v5, you can install both v4 and v5 side-by-side by [following the steps listed here](https://stately.ai/docs/migration#how-can-i-use-both-xstate-v4-and-v5). Once you've completed those steps, you'll end up with both dependencies in your `package.json`. Here's an example with libraries pegged to the latest version at the time of this writing but you can also use `npm:xstate@latest` if you prefer.

```json5
// package.json after completing the steps in the migration guide
{
  dependencies: {
    xstate: '4.38.2',
    xstate5: 'npm:xstate@5.6.0',
    '@xstate/react': '3.2.2',
    '@xstate/react5': 'npm:@xstate/react@4.0.3',
  },
}
```

:::tip

Alternatively, you can also default `xstate` to v5 and use `xstate4` for v4.

:::

### 2. Move types to `setup()` and remove typegen

One of the first migration steps, based on a breaking change, is to remove any TypeScript types in `schema` from v4. These types should then be [included under a new `types` property](https://stately.ai/docs/typescript#specifying-types) in the object passed to the new `setup()` function.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="v5" label="XState v5">

```ts
import { setup } from 'xstate';

const machine = setup({
  types: {} as {
    context: {
      /* type context props */
    },
    events: {
      /* type events */
    },
    // Type actors here
    input:  {
      nameOfActorSource1: {
        output: {
          prop1: string;
          prop2: number;
          /* etc */
        };
      };
      nameOfActorSource2: {
        /* type actor */
      };
      nameOfActorSource3: {
        /* type actor */
      };
    },
  }
  },
  /* implementations */
  actions: {},
  guards: {},
  actors: {},
}).createMachine({
  /* machine config */
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="v4" label="XState v4">

```ts
// ❌ DEPRECATED
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({
  ...
  tsTypes: {} as import('./myMachine.typegen').Typegen0,
  schema: {
    context: {} as {
      /* type context props */
    },
    events: {} as {
      /* type events */
    },
    services: {} as {
      /* type services */
    },
  }
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

You can still pass `types` to `createMachine()` if you are using that on its own and if you prefer. However, if you chain `setup().createMachine()` then you must pass `types` to the call to `setup({ types: {} })`.

:::

If you were previously using typegen in v4, you can also delete `tsTypes` as there is no more typegen in v5.

### 3. Convert actions strings to parameterized actions

We must now [convert any action name strings to action objects](https://stately.ai/docs/migration#use-params-to-pass-params-to-actions--guards) which allows us to define an explicit `params` object (or primitive value) that will be received at runtime by our action implementations. There are two ways to do this:

We can define `params` as a [static value](https://stately.ai/docs/actions#action-objects)

```ts
actions: [
  {
    // Action type
    type: 'track',
    // Action params
    params: { response: 'good' },
  },
],
```

We can also use [dynamic action parameters](https://stately.ai/docs/actions#dynamic-action-parameters), a function that receives `context` and/or `event`, allowing you to map those values to the `params` object.

```ts
entry: [
  {
    type: 'logInitialRating',
    params: ({ context }) => ({
      initialRating: context.initialRating,
    }),
  },
];
```

Here is a more complete example of converting action strings to parameterized actions:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="v5" label="XState v5">

```ts
import { setup } from 'xstate';

const machine = setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as {
      type: 'next';
      prop1: string;
      prop2: number;
      prop3: boolean;
    },
  },
  /* more setup */
}).createMachine({
  on: {
    next: {
      target: 'first',
      actions: [
        {
          type: 'doThis',
          // Later, the action implementation function will be
          // passed this string value as the 2nd arg, params.
          params: ({ event }) => event.prop1,
        },
        {
          type: 'doThat',
          // Later, the action implementation function will be
          // passed this number value as the 2nd arg, params.
          params: ({ event }) => event.prop2,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  states: {
    first: {
      entry: {
        type: 'whenEntering',
        // Later, the action implementation function will be
        // passed only these 2 values as the 2nd arg, params.
        params: ({ event }) => ({
          prop1: event.prop1,
          prop2: event.prop2,
        }),
      },
      exit: {
        type: 'whenExiting',
        // Later, the action implementation function will be
        // passed only these 2 values as the 2nd arg, params.
        params: ({ event }) => ({
          prop2: event.prop2,
          prop3: event.prop3,
        }),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="v4" label="XState v4">

```ts
// ❌ DEPRECATED
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({
  on: {
    next: {
      actions: ['doThis', 'doThat'],
    },
  },
  states: {
    first: {
      entry: 'whenEntering',
      exit: 'whenExiting',
    },
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Include implementations or stubs to `setup()`

We must [provide implementations for actions, guards, and actors](https://stately.ai/docs/machines#providing-implementations) in the object passed to `setup()`. If the machine has everything it needs to carry out these implementations on its own then these will be the actual implementations. However, if the machine needs to receive dependencies from the outside world, then these will be stubs that will be overridden later. You may end up passing a combination of concrete implementations and stubs to `setup()` which is perfectly fine.

:::info

When using TypeScript, the implementations passed to `setup()` must include types for the 2nd params argument.

:::

```ts
setup({
  actions: {
    doThis: (_, prop1: string) => {
      // Concrete implementation here
      console.log(prop1);
    },
    // Stubbed implementation
    doThat: (_, prop2: number) => {},
    whenEntering: (_, params: { prop1: string; prop2: number }) => {
      // Concrete implementation here
      console.log(prop1, prop2);
    },
    // Stubbed implementation
    whenExiting: (_, params: { prop2: number; prop3: boolean }) => {},
  },
});
```

:::tip

Even dependencies that are external to the machine can be made available to the machine.

:::

**Injecting external dependencies with `input`**

If dependencies are not expected to change throughout the lifetime of the machine, then you can pass them as `input` to `setup()` and they will become available from within the machine.

```ts
setup({
  input: {
    externalDependency1: someRef,
    externalDependency2: anotherRef,
  },
});
```

**Injecting external dependencies by sending an event**

If dependencies are expected to change over time, then you can send an event to the machine, as often as necessary (whenever dependencies change), to update the machine with the latest dependencies. For example, an event containing refs to these dependencies can be used by registered actions or actors or they can be stored in context using an `assign` action for future use.

```ts
send({
  type: 'refs.inject',
  externalDependency1,
  externalDependency2,
});
```

However, in some cases it's just not feasible or convenient to inject dependencies. There may be too many dependencies or perhaps you seek to avoid tightly coupling the machine to those dependencies. The next section describes how to provide concrete implementations to override the stubbed implementations, on a per-use basis throughout your application.

### 5. Provide concrete implementations

Stately Studio is a NextJS application so we are using the [@xstate/react](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-react) package in our React components. We can provide concrete implementations to our stubs by using the `useActorRef()` hook. This hook allows us to pass in a machine and receive an actor ref that we can use to send events to that machine. We can provide dependencies to the machine such as our concrete implementations.

```ts
import { machine } from './machine';

const actorRef = useActorRef(
  machine.provide({
    actions: {
      doThat: (_, prop2) => {
        // Concrete implementation here
        console.log(prop2);
      },
      whenExiting: (_, params) => {
        // Concrete implementation here
        console.log(params.prop2, params.prop3);
      },
    },
  }),
);
```

:::info

`machine.provide()` returns the same `machine` but with the provided implementations. This is useful if you want to provide different implementations to different instances of the same machine.

:::

In other components we may be using a context provider to give access to an actor ref at various levels in the component tree. A machine context provider can be created using a machine:

```ts
import { createMachine } from './machine';
import { createActorContext } from '@xstate/react';

const machine = setup({
  /* setup config */
}).createMachine({
  /* machine config */
});

export const MachineContext = createActorContext(machine);
```

It can then be imported and used in a component tree:

```tsx
import { MachineContext } from './MachineContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <MachineContext.Provider
      logic={machine.provide({
        actions: {
          doThat: (_, prop2) => {
            // Concrete implementation here
            console.log(prop2);
          },
          whenExiting: (_, params) => {
            // Concrete implementation here
            console.log(params.prop2, params.prop3);
          },
        },
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </MachineContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

In this case, the [provider is passed a `logic` prop](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-react#createactorcontextlogic) whose value is the machine with the provided implementations. All the way down the component tree, we can use the [`useActorRef()` hook](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-react#useactorrefmachine-options) to access the actor ref and send events to the machine that is using these concrete implementations.

:::info

These implementation functions do not need to be typed because the `params` argument passed to them has already been typed by [implementations passed into the `setup()` function in the previous step](#4-move-implementations-or-stubs-to-setup).
