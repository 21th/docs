Statecharts and visual diagrams are such a powerful way to organize, and convey information. All of those lovely “boxes and arrows” convey meaningful relationships, indicate sequential order, and direct flows in a way that’s easier to understand quickly. Add to that the ability to [attach assets to your diagrams](https://stately.ai/docs/assets) and you’re well on your way towards creating truly expressive, executable software diagrams. But there’s still one thing that statecharts have that should make them easy to understand. Text.

When I say text, I’m largely referring to names. States, events, actors, actions, and guards all have names. These are important since they’re included in the executable code or other [formats that are exported from Studio](https://stately.ai/docs/export-as-code) , functioning as unique ids (or shared) so they’re not just for decoration. Many users often ask us for guidance on how to name things in their state machines and in XState.

Some of these requests relate to semantic meaning in regards to the elements of a statechart. Should a state be named “Awake” or “Waking Up”? Should an event be called “Shuffle the deck” or “Shuffling”? The other questions we get are more cosmetic like, “Should state names start with a capital letter?” or “Should multi-word names be separated by spaces, dashes, or underscores?” The former deserves an answer like “it depends” because it does depened on many things: What is the state really doing? What are the names of the other states or events? Does the state have child states and, if so, what’s their purpose and how are they named? You get the picture. The latter group gets an equally frustrating answer, the same answer I get whenever I travel and ask locals “Do I need to tip in this country?”. And that answer is… “Up to you.”

But don’t worry, I wouldn’t leave you hanging out to dry when it comes to something as hard as naming. Here are some basic guidelines to consider when it comes to naming things in your statecharts:

### Clarity of meaning

Just like with naming anything in code, it’s helpful to pick names that are brief, not generic, yet contain just enough information to be unambiguous. Make names “minimally meaningful”.

State name examples:

- "Idle" instead of "State1"
- "Door Closed" instead of "Closed"
- "Payment Processing" instead of "State_Awaiting_Payment"

Event name examples:

- "userClickedSubmit" instead of "Event1"
- "temperatureExceededThreshold" instead of "ThresholdReached"
- "paymentReceived" instead of "Event_Payment_Received"

### Improved readability

One of my favorite tips for statechart naming is to use contrasting styles. Contrast is a key ingredient for many things we love from food to color, art, and music. The readability of statecharts can also benefit from contrast. If you use SHOUTY_UPPERCASE event names the please don’t also use that case for state names or… anything else in the same machine really. At the same time, don’t just name every state, event, and action in “plain lower case” unless you want your statechart to be read like the equivalent of a bored teen with “vocal fry”. Differentiation can help readers distinguish certain elements of the statechart from others and this applies to readability on the editor canvas as well as in code.

### Consistency is Key

You can do whatever you want (remember, “Up to you”) but whatever you decide, try to be consistent. Readers will learn the convention you choose and they’ll be able to rely on it. If you name states “Waiting”, “Downloading”, “Synchronizing” then when they see another word ending in “ing” they’ll probably assume it’s also a state. If you name entry actions and exit actions on states as well as actions on transitions all with camelCase then it’s clear that these are actions regardless of what they’re attached to. So remember, consistency is key and in an XState config object, most of these names end up exported as actual object keys!

### Conventions and maintenance

From consistency, conventions often emerge. These could be conventions adhered to across a statechart, an entire project or across all of the projects of a particular user or team. This makes the work easier to understand and easier to maintain, thereby streamlining collaboration.

### Summary

Naming and styles is a matter of taste but also an opportunity for customization and personalization for individual users or teams. Manual renaming and enforcing conventions is quite tedious and time consuming so it’s more efficient to apply styles with a single click. Considering how easy it is now to apply styles, undo them, try out other combinations, and save your work, you can be free to experiment and to arrive at a style that best suits you. When your machines look good, you’re lookin’ good too!
