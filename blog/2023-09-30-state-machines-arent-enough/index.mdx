You might have heard us use the terms “state machine” and “statechart” interchangeably and wondered “what’s the difference”?
If that’s you, then please read on!

A little while ago, David wrote a [lovely post](TODO- add link to post here) explaining what exactly a state machine is, its components, and how they can be used to model logic in a testable and predictable way. 
It’s really easy to forget about covering the basics when we're immersed in the world of boxes and arrows all day!
So, this post aims to build on that last one and cover a step up in logic modeling complexity: statecharts.
You may have also heard us use the term “statechart” almost interchangeably with state machine, but they're not quite the same thing.
While state machines are an excellent way to describe application logic, processes, workflows, etc... they can only go so far. 
Statecharts were designed to address some of the limitations of state machines by adding a few key concepts: hierarchy, and concurrency.


## Going back in time
I'd be remiss if I didn't cover the fact that statecharts are not a new concept.
As a matter of fact, they're quite old. Statecharts are the brainchild of [David Harel back in 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642387900359?via%3Dihub).
State machines excel at defining logic for a single entity or process, but they aren't ideal when one needs to represent the the communication or interoperability between one process and another.
For example, we can model a person using a washing machine as a state machine from a high level. The person loads clothes, shuts the door, selects a cycle, and then the starts the machine. 
After some time, the machine finishes and the person unloads the clothes.
At a high level, this works, but it doesn't really capture all the details of the washing machine process! 
What if we needed to model both the person interacting with the washer and the washer itself? That's where statecharts add value. 
With a proper hierarchy, we can show the sub-states and transitions happening in the washing process, like filling the tub, agitating, draining, rinsing, etc... all while maintaining the higher order steps with the person interacting with the washer!
Where state machines are great at defining the logic of a single entity, statecharts are great at defining the logic of a system of entities.
